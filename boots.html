    <h2 class="poem-title">Boots</h2>
    <p>
      My grandfather and his men </br>
      Would ride their horses </br>
      Into the swamps </br>
      On nights that sung and flew </br>
      Full of blood like mosquitoes </br>
      And draw their pistols to fire </br>
      At the snakes that struck </br>
      One terrible circle after another </br>
      All so we could come later</br>
      With knives tied to broomsticks.</br>
      This was the reason for mud, whiskey, and the river,</br>
      Also bad debts and weather,</br>
      Mysterious birds robbing the orchard</br>
      Who disappeared like favorite daughters.</br>
      This was the reason for women weeping in the rain.
