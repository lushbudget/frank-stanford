    <h2 class="poem-title">Death and the Young Man</h2>
    <p>
      The birds swirl in the afternoon  </br>
      Like fixings in the dark pot </br>
      My mother stirred. </br>
      </br>
      Now the shadows go out </br>
      And are lost in the evening </br>
      Like wine and blood and ink </br>
      </br>
      I would like to sink down </br>
      In a basket of folded laundry </br>
      But the moon is dirty here at night. </br>
      </br>
      When the sun is remembered like broken eggs</br>
      In her coat, I come back over my own scent </br>
      The dog who stole them.
