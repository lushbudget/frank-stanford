    <h2 class="poem-title">The Deep Sleep of the Fox</h2>
    <p>
      Dogs barking and men coming out on deck </br>
      to take a leak and look around afraid</br>
      afraid the stranger will come back and walk</br>
      in their simple gardens in his black coat</br>
      and large hat and iron mirror shoveling the loam</br>
      from the pasts scattering it all over</br>
      the beehives and old boots the hemispheres</br>
      of the wise and lonely who ruined their names</br>
      echoes of the farmgirl calling her slow</br>
      rooster filled with light like a virgin's head</br>
      trapped under the earth which is also deep
     </p>
